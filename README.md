Python Zip Import.
This series of Python scripts is written to demonstrate the use of the zipimport module (Import modules from Zip archives). 
This module adds the ability to import Python modules (*.py, *.pyc) and packages from ZIP-format archives. 
It is usually not needed to use the zipimport module explicitly; it is automatically used by the built-in import mechanism for sys.path items that are paths to ZIP archives.
